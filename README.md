# Programming_Skills_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to investigate current trends in technology usage and skills. More specifically, it is intended to look at current program language, database, webframe, and platform useage and see how those demands are expected to change in the future.

To accomplish this goal, data was taken from a [StackOverflow survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in) and obtained from GitHub jobs via utilization of their API and webscraping. 

Contained within this repository are the jupyter notebooks that were used to complete the analysis, the excel results generated, and a pdf copy of the report that was given based on the results.
